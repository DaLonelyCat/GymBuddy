# GymBuddy 🚀

A simple, offline-first gym application to track your workouts and progress.

Your personal workout companion, always available.

## About

GymBuddy is a basic Android application designed to help users track their workouts offline. It provides a simple and intuitive interface for logging exercises, sets, reps, and weights, allowing users to monitor their progress over time. The app is built with a focus on offline functionality, ensuring that users can access their workout data even without an internet connection.

This project aims to solve the problem of relying on cloud-based services for workout tracking, which can be unreliable in areas with poor connectivity or when privacy is a concern. GymBuddy targets individuals who prefer a straightforward, offline solution for managing their fitness routines.

The app is primarily built using Java for the Android platform. Key technologies include Android SDK components for UI development, data persistence mechanisms (likely using SQLite or Room for local storage), and potentially some basic charting libraries for visualizing progress. The architecture follows a Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern to separate concerns and improve testability.
